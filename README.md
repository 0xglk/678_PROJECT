# Beat LLMs at Their Own Game: Zero-Shot LLM-Generated Text Detection via Querying ChatGPT
## Data
* For the Finance dataset, we use the ChatGPT-generated texts collected by Guo et al. [1]
* The human-written texts and ChatGPT-generated texts of the Finance dataset are in the finance.jsonl file.
* The ChatGPT-revised version for human-written texts of the Finance dataset is in the revised_human_finance.txt file.
* The ChatGPT-revised version for ChatGPT-generated texts of the Finance dataset is in the revised_chatgpt_finance.txt file.
* When we revise texts with ChatGPT, we use the
gpt-3.5-turbo API provided by OpenAI. All experiments that call gpt-3.5-turbo API in
the paper are done before June 2023, with the gpt-3.5-turbo API being gpt-3.5-turbo-0301.

## Installation
Set up your environment to run the detection code by following these steps:

 Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the code 
   ```bash
   python finance_bart_auroc.py
```

## Code
* To evaluate the detection performance of our method on the Finance dataset, please run the code "python finance_bart_auroc.py".
* Before running the program to enable **LLM functionality**, you need to add the ChatGPT API Key to the code. It's simply done by including it in the code.

**OPEN AND EDIT finance_bart_auroc.py**
   ```bash
   # OpenAI API key setup
client = openai.api_key='YOUR KEY HERE'
```
  
  We use the BARTScore-CNN [2] as
the similarity metric to calculate similarity scores.

### Key Addition:
- **Switching Compute Devices Section**: Added a section on how to switch the compute device from CPU to GPU for users who might want to utilize GPU acceleration. 
change on **bart_score.py** and **finance_bart_auroc.py** code 
Find the line in each script that specifies the device:
change it from "**device='cpu'** to **device='cuda:0'**"
